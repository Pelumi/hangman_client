# hangman client

A light weight (ugly) test client built with Angular for the classic hangman game. 

It consumes the services exposed by [hangman backend.](https://github.com/Pelumi/hangman_backend)

This project skeleton was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)

## Build & development

Ensure grunt, bower are installed: npm install -g grunt-cli bower

If you have wiredep issues, run: bower install

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
